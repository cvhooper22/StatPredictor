This is the source code for a simple stat predictor that takes in halftime stats and an opponent's season averages as entered by a user.  It then loads a season averages file for your team (that you specify), loads a WEKA MLP model, and tries to update the statistics until a win is achieved.  The byu_avgs and duke_avgs files can be loaded by the program to initialize it with the averages for either of those teams.  These averages are used to help set upper and lower bounds to the program.

Right now this program needs some work.  The amount to update each stat needs work, especially to get realistic pts for, pts against, and possession numbers.  In the future I hope to add a feature where you can add shot attempts and makes instead of the percentages and then let to program calculate the percentages and other stats based off of that.
